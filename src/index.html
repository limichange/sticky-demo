                      Whenever President Donald Trump is questioned about why
                      the United States has nearly three times more coronavirus
                      cases than the entire European Union, or why hundreds of
                      Americans are still dying every day, he whips out one
                      standard comment. We find so many cases, he contends,
                      because we test so many people. The remark typifies
                      Trump’s deep distrust of data: his wariness of what it
                      will reveal, and his eagerness to distort it. In April,
                      when he refused to allow coronavirus-stricken passengers
                      off the Grand Princess cruise liner and onto American soil
                      for medical treatment, he explained: “I like the numbers
                      where they are. I don’t need to have the numbers double
                      because of one ship.” Unable—or unwilling—to fix the
                      problem, Trump’s instinct is to fix the numbers instead.

                      The administration has failed on so many different fronts
                      in its handling of the coronavirus, creating the overall
                      impression of sheer mayhem. But there is a common thread
                      that runs through these government malfunctions. Precise,
                      transparent data is crucial in the fight against a
                      pandemic—yet through a combination of ineptness and active
                      manipulation, the government has depleted and corrupted
                      the key statistics that public health officials rely on to
                      protect us.
                    </p>

                      of its customary duty of collating national numbers on
                      COVID-19 patients. Instead, the Department of Health and
                      Human Services instructed hospitals to funnel their
                      information to the government via TeleTracking, a small
                      Tennessee firm started by a real estate entrepreneur who
                      has

                      to the Republican Party. For a while, past data
                      disappeared from the CDC’s website entirely, and although
                      it reappeared after an outcry, it was never updated
                      thereafter. The TeleTracking system was riddled with
                      errors, and the newest statistics sometimes appeared after
                      delays. This has severely limited the ability of public
                      health officials to determine where new clusters of
                      COVID-19 are blooming, to notice demographic patterns in
                      the spread of the disease, or to allocate ICU beds to
                      those who need them most.

                    <p>
                      To make matters more confusing still, Jared Kushner moved
                      to start a separate coronavirus surveillance system run
                      out of the White House and built by health technology
                      giants—burdening

                        >already-overwhelmed officials</a
                      >
                      and health care experts with a needless stream of queries.
                      Kushner’s assessments often contradicted those of agencies
                      working on the ground. When Andrew Cuomo, New York’s
                      governor, asked for 30,000 ventilators, Kushner claimed
                      the state didn’t need them: “I’m doing my own projections,
                      and I’ve gotten a lot smarter about this.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      One of the administration’s most consequential failures
                      was that it didn’t establish uniform reporting standards
                      for states and counties. All the numbers from local
                      agencies were just tipped into a mass of detail that was
                      “inconsistent, incomplete, and inaccessible,” according to
                      <a target="_blank" href="a report">a report</a> published
                      by the American Public Health Association, the Johns
                      Hopkins Center, and Resolve to Save Lives, a nonprofit led
                      by a former CDC director. But Trump also urged authorities
                      to slow down coronavirus testing. “Instead of 25 million
                      tests, let’s say we did 10 million tests,” he told CBN
                      News. “We’d look like we were doing much better because
                      we’d have far fewer cases. You understand that.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      While Anthony Fauci, the government’s leading expert on
                      COVID-19, was undergoing surgery and conveniently
                      anaesthetized in late August, the CDC changed its
                      guidelines to stop recommending testing for asymptomatic
                      people, even those who had been in contact with carriers
                      of the virus. Two federal health officials told The New
                      York Times that the instruction came from higher-ups at
                      the White House, even though experts think the U.S. needed
                      more testing at that point in the pandemic, not less. The
                      situation became so overtly politicized that Dr. Rick
                      Bright, the former director of the Biomedical Advanced
                      Research and Development Authority, came up with a plan
                      for a national testing infrastructure, only to be
                      sidelined by higher-ups. He resigned from his position in
                      the National Institutes of Health on October 6. “He can no
                      longer countenance working for an administration that puts
                      politics over science to the great detriment of the
                      American people,” Bright’s attorneys said in a statement.

                      Even details about Trump’s own bout of COVID-19—whether
                      the president had been on oxygen, or a clear timeline of
                      how long he had been infected—were suppressed or spun, by

                      country, Americans are witnessing the chaos and dangers
                      that ensue when the integrity of data is leached away.

                      The frightening thing is that Trump’s war on data isn’t
                      limited to the pandemic. It has been waged throughout the
                      federal government, warping policy and enfeebling
                      institutions from the inside. Over nearly four years, his
                      administration has defunded, buried and constrained dozens
                      of federal research and data collection projects across
                      multiple agencies and spheres of policy: environment,
                      agriculture, labor, health, immigration, energy, the
                      census. “It scares me,” said Katherine Smith Evans, a
                      former administrator of the Economic Research Service, an
                      agency under the U.S. Department of Agriculture. “There
                      are enough chances to make bad policy without lacking the
                      data to make good policy.” We are witnessing a widespread
                      act of erasure.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The impulse to ascribe this to a Republican devotion to
                      small government is a mistaken one. “I don’t see an
                      all-hands-on-board effort to get rid of everything,”
                      Katherine Wallman, who was the chief statistician of the
                      U.S. from 1992 to 2017, told me. “What I do see is that
                      they’re taking on the inconvenient data. Or trying to get
                      data that could help a particular point.” The ERS, which
                      Evans ran until 2011, is a prime case. Sonny Perdue, the
                      secretary of agriculture,

                      last year that the agency’s research—which, among many
                      other things, tells America how crop prices are moving,
                      what school lunches ought to contain and who needs food
                      stamps—was “based on political science rather than strong
                      science.” The ERS was finding repeatedly that trade deals
                      benefit U.S. farmers and that federal spending on food
                      stamps had dropped steadily since 2013,

                      In June 2019, Perdue told the ERS that its offices would
                      be relocating from Washington, D.C., to Kansas City,
                      Missouri. It was a tactic of brute force, executed in the
                      knowledge that many employees wouldn’t move their lives
                      halfway across the country. Budgets were scheduled to be

                      The meticulous assembly of numbers is one of the
                      government’s most overlooked functions, but it’s also one
                      of the most vital. Federal statistics inform the
                      administration about what problems have arisen, who is in
                      distress, and where resources need to go. Citizens
                      aggregate themselves in public data—forcing the state to
                      heed them when individually they might be muted or
                      ignored, and holding officials accountable if their needs
                      aren’t met. By gutting the collection of federal
                      statistics, the Trump administration is burning away the
                      government’s capacity to regulate. By attacking numeracy,
                      it is attacking democracy.

                      A third of the way into the 20th century, the U.S. went
                      through a revolution of statistics. Until then, the
                      methods of quantifying a country had changed slowly and
                      incrementally. In 1921, President Warren Harding found
                      that he had no unemployment numbers, so he called a
                      conference to canvass opinions on how many working-age
                      Americans didn’t have jobs. Then the figure was put to a
                      vote. The most popular guess—between 3.5 million and 5
                      million—was published in the conference’s report. That was
                      how hard up for data the government was.

                    <p>
                      Having accurate statistics for unemployment could have
                      significantly eased the pain of the Great Depression. In
                      1930, President Herbert Hoover’s administration relied on
                      a federal agency that counted new hires but not layoffs.
                      It should have turned instead to the Bureau of Labor
                      Statistics, which was summing up lost jobs and thus
                      capturing the actual, terrifying scale of the economic
                      collapse. The same year, when the government tried to
                      distort the numbers from a census of unemployment, the
                      economist in charge resigned in protest. Lacking the kind
                      of data that revealed the severity of the Depression, the
                      state came up with pitifully inadequate solutions. In
                      1930, Hoover’s government sponsored two bills, totaling
                      just an extra $100 million in public works spending. Then
                      Congress adjourned over the summer without enacting any
                      additional laws, “in the face of desperate need,” as the
                      American Federationist reported. Throughout 1930, the
                      first full year of the Depression, the administration
                      soothed itself with dodgy data. By 1931, 8 million
                      Americans were out of work, up from 1.5 million in 1929,
                      and the economy had become a calamity.

                      The revolution began in 1933, after Franklin D. Roosevelt
                      took office. New statistical agencies were opened. Their
                      work was better funded, and more sophisticated methods
                      took root. Roosevelt’s government sampled urban housing,
                      workers on welfare, and consumer purchasing; a health
                      study surveyed 700,000 families in 83 cities and 23 rural
                      counties; the cost of living index was revised and revised
                      again; when Social Security was introduced, its data was
                      stored on punch cards for easy analysis. The New Deal’s
                      pump was primed by statistics.

                      Among those who work with public data, the canonical
                      tale—the example that statisticians, economists, civil
                      servants and academics recalled to me most often to
                      illustrate how government data produces policy that
                      indisputably helps hundreds of millions of people—is that
                      of lead in blood. For nearly half a century now, white
                      semitrailers with “National Health and Nutrition
                      Examination Survey” stenciled on their sides have been

                      volunteer. They run blood panels, check teeth and perform
                      ultrasounds. They administer questionnaire after
                      questionnaire; the one on hearing ability alone has 41
                      questions. The surveys now occur on a two-year cycle; the
                      2015-16 edition examined nearly 10,000 people. Not many
                      broader surveys are this deep; not many deeper surveys are
                      this broad. The data collected by NHANES is one of the
                      federal government’s richest resources in shaping health
                      policy.

                    <p>
                      In 1976, for the first time, NHANES began to test for
                      levels of lead. After blood was drawn from a vein, it was
                      frozen, packed into dry ice, and shipped to a lab in
                      Atlanta. The results stunned officials. The blood of
                      Americans held far more lead than anyone had expected. “We
                      knew there was lead in paint, and that children were
                      ingesting paint,” said Charles Rothwell, the director of
                      the National Center for Health Statistics, which conducts
                      NHANES. “But there were fairly high levels even in areas
                      that probably weren’t impacted by paint.” The reason, of
                      course, was leaded gasoline, which had been known for
                      decades to be toxic. But both leaded paint and leaded gas
                      had been kept on the market by bullying lobbies and pliant
                      governments. Until the 1970s, no federal funds had been
                      devoted to the study of lead levels at all. Industries
                      were producing

                        >their own data</a
                      >, arguing that a base measure of lead in the blood was
                      normal, and that atmospheric lead didn’t poison people.
                      NHANES proved them wrong. In adults, lead damages the
                      kidneys, causes problems during pregnancies, harms the
                      nerves and triggers anaemia. In children, lead markedly
                      stunts the brain, resulting in slowed growth, learning and
                      speech defects, and impeded intelligence. No amount of
                      lead in a child’s blood, we now know, can be considered
                      safe.

                      A ban on lead-based paint went into effect in 1978, soon
                      after a phased reduction of leaded gas. As NHANES
                      continued its work, it was able to chart how lead
                      concentrations in its blood samples were dropping rapidly.
                      These statistics first helped defeat a petition from the
                      Lead Industries Association to relax the law and then, in
                      1985, to persuade the Environmental Protection Agency to
                      demand that gas companies

                      The spine of federal data has always been the decennial
                      census, the latest edition of which is being conducted
                      this year. The kind of cross-section the census provides
                      to officials at every level is impossible to beat, said
                      Joe Salvo, the director of the population division in New
                      York City’s Department of City Planning: “We may complain
                      about the census, its warts and so on. But when we walk
                      through a neighborhood, we see the data come alive.” Every
                      city department uses census statistics as a baseline, and
                      builds more layers of information atop it. The health
                      department, for example, tracks asthma cases to see if
                      they’re higher in some pockets of the city—but it must
                      first know how many people live in these pockets.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Salvo told me a story of how census data helps New York
                      react to emergencies. In 2012, as Hurricane Sandy was
                      preparing to make landfall, the city’s health department
                      realized that not every emergency shelter could be
                      equipped with a generator. “Health came to us, wanting to
                      know the neighborhoods with significant numbers of
                      vulnerable people, aged 75 or older,” Salvo said. The
                      census told him that 108,000 people in that demographic
                      lived in areas liable to be inundated. The shelters near
                      their homes received generators first. “The city also has
                      an evacuation fleet of 50 buses,” he said. “Where should
                      we put them? If we had to guess, can you imagine what a
                      mess that would be?” Laying census data over sea level
                      data furnished the answer: Brighton Beach, southern
                      Brooklyn, northern Queens, parts of Staten Island. “Turns
                      out, you can really do well with 50 buses if you have the
                      right data,” Salvo said.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The 2020 census will be Salvo’s fourth. Every census
                      experiences some kind of friction. New York argued that
                      the 2010 census undercounted the residents of Queens and
                      Brooklyn; the Supreme Court had to weigh in on part of the
                      methodology of the 2000 census; the 1990 census

                      >
                      and double-counted 4 million others. But none of that came
                      close to the anxiety triggered by the Trump
                      administration’s proposal to add a citizenship question to
                      the census, Salvo said. “There’s been a level of fear and
                      apprehension that has gone beyond immigrant communities,”
                      he said, even after the government withdrew its proposal
                      in July 2019. “We have so many people in mixed-status
                      households, where one person is a citizen, one is a legal
                      resident, one or two are perhaps undocumented.” People
                      were afraid that their answers to the census’ questions
                      would be summoned later and used against them.

                    <p>
                      And when people are afraid, they skip out on the census
                      altogether. In

                      last year, 26 percent of Black adults, 21 percent of
                      Hispanics, and a third of young Americans indicated a
                      reluctance to respond. Salvo couldn’t imagine a worse
                      situation. “It all ultimately comes down to whether you’re
                      in the data. If you don’t answer the census, it’s like you
                      don’t exist,” he said. “If you see your compatriots aren’t
                      answering, it’s like your community doesn’t exist. The
                      ramifications are serious—for dollars budgeted for the
                      city, but also for our ability to get to you help.” Even
                      the threat of asking about citizenship, he said, chilled
                      many people’s intent to participate. Under Trump, the
                      census has already shriveled in other ways. Compared to
                      2010, the Census Bureau

                      the number of local offices it operates around the
                      country, and it hired fewer staff to follow up with people
                      who fail to participate at first. Ultimately, the Supreme
                      Court allowed the Trump administration to end the census
                      early, and it is scheduled to review shortly Trump’s
                      proposal to exclude undocumented immigrants when
                      determining how congressional seats are apportioned. But a
                      resistance to being included in the census is a deeper,
                      more existential quandary. Most Americans, Rothwell told
                      me, don’t think of themselves as being in a position to do
                      something for their government. “I keep wanting to say to
                      them, 'The information you give us about yourselves in
                      these surveys—this is how it’s being used, these are the
                      benefits that come out of it. This is how you’re helping
                      your neighbors, and your country.'”

                      The erosion of data across the federal government is
                      particularly insidious because it’s relatively invisible
                      to the public at large. Often, the only people who know
                      the value of these sets of numbers are those who work with
                      them daily. The life-and-death implications of data can be
                      highly technical and hard to convey. But looking at the
                      kinds of data being erased, a clear narrative of political
                      intent emerges.

                      In 2017, Immigration and Customs Enforcement stopped
                      publishing routine data about its enforcement raids, and
                      it no longer updates the list of deaths occurring in its
                      custody. Health and Human Services has wiped information
                      on how Obamacare impacts public health, and has started to
                      leave out questions about LGBTQ people in surveys that
                      assess the needs of elderly and disabled Americans. The
                      Justice Department has not released any numbers for deaths
                      in correctional institutions since 2016. The first
                      federally funded study on sex trafficking in Native
                      American communities has been shut down. Reports on arms
                      sales to other countries are vanishing. Every instance
                      speaks to a desire to evade accountability, to a narrow
                      ideological impulse, or to an appeasement of commercial
                      interests—and sometimes all three at once.

                      The damage has perhaps been most prolific on environmental
                      matters. The health risks of a variety of industrial
                      pollutants—coal dust from mountaintop mining,
                      formaldehyde, chemicals called PFAs—were being
                      investigated until the government shut down the studies.
                      Funding for clean energy research was withheld. The Obama
                      administration had ordered the tracking of methane
                      emissions by the oil and gas industry; the Trump
                      administration reversed that order. Companies are taking
                      their cue from the government, said Christopher Sellers,
                      an environmental historian at Stony Brook University.
                      Sellers sits on the coordinating committee of the
                      Environmental Data and Governance Initiative, a network of
                      academics and activists who started to archive tranches of
                      environmental data in publicly accessible servers as soon
                      as Trump took office. So far, EDGI has salted away more
                      than 200 terabytes of data, but Sellers has noticed that
                      the government’s attitude has emboldened companies to
                      stint on fresh statistics as well. “I’ve been looking at
                      other greenhouse gas reporting by oil and gas facilities,
                      and the number of facilities reporting these gas emissions
                      is trending downwards.” The void left by all this data
                      doesn’t just make it difficult to frame policy to fight
                      pollution and climate change; it cements the argument that
                      there’s nothing to fight at all.

                      What will happen when public facts and figures disappear?
                      Sellers pointed me to the EPA’s decision to pull the
                      funding of a long-term study on a chemical called
                      chlorpyrifos. The study is part of the work of 13 research
                      centers—all defunded now—that examine how adverse health
                      in adults might result from childhood exposure to
                      chemicals. For two decades, the Columbia Center for
                      Children’s Environmental Health has tracked hundreds of
                      children in New York, and

                      >
                      have shown that chlorpyrifos, a chemical found in
                      pesticides and patented by Dow, can distort brain
                      development in the womb. Children go into seizures, or
                      lapse into lethargy or coma, but their symptoms are
                      particularly difficult to diagnose. Chlorpyrifos is only
                      permitted for use now on agricultural land, and the EPA
                      nearly prohibited even that in 2015. Now the chemical has
                      a new life in the market, and a deficit of data will
                      hinder anyone who wishes to press for a ban. The cognitive
                      skills of children living near farmland and being exposed
                      to chlorpyrifos may dip and wane, as an older

                      has already suggested. But by abandoning its support of
                      the Columbia study, the government has made it harder to
                      protect such children. “What’s happening with
                      chlorpyrifos,” Sellers said, “is the exact antithesis to
                      what happened with lead and gasoline.”

                    <p>
                      Every set of public data is valuable twice over—by virtue
                      of the information it holds, and by virtue of being
                      accessible to anyone. Even if the Trump administration is
                      rubbing out the latter, it cannot eliminate the former.
                      Companies are avid consumers of public data; Starbucks
                      crunches government demographics to work out where to
                      locate stores, Deloitte analyzes business trends using the
                      Bureau of Labor Statistics’ inflation index, and crop
                      insurance firms look to ERS research to price premiums. In
                      the absence of these sources, the gathering of such
                      information will merely move into the private sector, to
                      be sold to companies as statistical intelligence. You
                      might still call this public data, but only in the sense
                      that it is data about the public; otherwise, the import of
                      this data will be closely held, the benefits accruing only
                      to those with the money to buy them. This isn’t
                      speculation; it has already happened. In his book “The
                      Fifth Risk,” Michael Lewis describes how the National
                      Weather Service missed spotting a tornado’s path through
                      Moore, Oklahoma, in the spring of 2015, and thus never
                      issued an alert. But AccuWeather, a private company that
                      relies on government data to refine its own forecasting,
                      knew that Moore was in danger. “The big point is that
                      AccuWeather never broadcast its tornado warning,” Lewis
                      writes. “The only people who received it were the people
                      who had paid for it—and God help those who hadn’t.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The privatization of government data will shape the data
                      itself: what gets counted, how it’s steered, what it
                      conveys. “If we privatize the collection of greenhouse gas
                      numbers, what’s the industry that’s most interested in
                      taking that on?” Sellers said. “Oil and gas companies.”
                      The data becomes vulnerable to manipulation—and that kills
                      the basis of public debate.

                    <p>
                      In the midst of a fractious election season, confidence in
                      data is vital. Across the political divide, we already
                      find it impossible to agree on what the news tells us and
                      which experts to believe. If data is hollowed out as well,
                      each side will bring its own numbers to every issue,
                      cooked to its own convenience. Consensus on policy is hard
                      enough to reach; without reliable data, we lose consensus
                      on what we should even begin to discuss.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      But the consequences of unreliable information resound far
                      beyond the election. The quality of data is hard to
                      separate from the quality of governance. The state’s
                      machinery works only if the data it is using to make its
                      decisions is sound and fair. After all, a nation is an act
                      of invention—an abstract, uncanny idea made real every day
                      by a million concrete things that citizens decide they
                      want for themselves. Food that is edible. Streets that are
                      safe to walk. Air that is clean. Workplaces that treat
                      people well. It is in the measures of these qualities—how
                      edible? how safe? how clean? how well?—that a nation
                      shapes itself. Four more years of data decay will fatally
                      weaken the government and its capacity to help its people.
                      The act of invention falters. The lead stays in the
                      gasoline.

              Good data about where the coronavirus is spreading, whom it’s
              affecting, and the capacity of health systems is essential for
              government officials to make better decisions on, for example,
              lockdown orders and where to send supplies. Epidemiologists and
              infectious disease experts can use the information to understand

              But over the past year, experts have watched with bewilderment at
              how the Trump administration has collected, distributed and used
              public health data. “We’re still flying blind,” said Ryan
              Panchadsaram, co-founder of the the United States Digital
              Response, an all-volunteer effort to

              erupted in May, when White House economist Kevin Hassett produced
              a set of charts on COVID-19 spread that appeared to predict a
              rapid decline in cases and deaths. In them, the country appeared
              to be nearly virus-free by summer. Hassett distributed the charts

              likely to cause a new surge in cases, which is precisely what
              happened.

              in how hospitals report their inpatient COVID-19 data. No longer
              would they submit information to the Centers for Disease Control
              and Prevention. Instead, hospitals would file data directly (or
              indirectly through state governments) to the Department of Health
              and Human Services.
            </p>

            <p>
              Administration officials said the change would allow them to
              collect more complete and standardized data. A chorus of angry
              public health officials, scientists and hospital representatives

              “Usually you’ve got months and months, sometimes years, to prepare
              for big changes like this,” said Chip Kahn, president of the

              Larger hospitals and those that were already using the HHS portal
              were mostly able to adapt. Smaller hospitals frequently struggled
              because they hadn’t been using the new system and because they
              didn’t have the dedicated IT staff of larger hospital networks.
              “The majority of our hospitals in Nebraska are rural, and the
              staff at these hospitals are often responsible for many roles,
              which can stretch resources very thin,” said Margaret Woeppel,
              vice president for quality and data at the Nebraska Hospital
              Association. “The nurse who is taking care of patients may also be
              responsible for quality reporting and infection control.”

            <p>
              Panchadsaram, who served as deputy chief technology officer during
              the Obama administration, said the quality of the data is slowly
              improving. But he identified another problem: The Trump
              administration isn’t sharing it with the public.

              Every week, the White House coronavirus task force puts together a
              detailed status report on the outbreak and the response for all 50
              states. It includes everything from test positivity rates to a
              breakdown of which communities have rising caseloads, along with
              policy recommendations. The task force gives each governor a copy
              of their state’s report, but otherwise doesn’t make them public.

              The White House has not responded to questions about why the
              reports remain private, leaving critics to wonder whether
              administration officials are reluctant to publish information that
              might contradict the optimistic outlook of, say, the president or
              some Reublican governors. “They have a really good analytics team
              creating these beautiful reports, those reports have really
              important recommendations on them, and they're not making them
              public,” Panchadsaram said. “Maybe that is because the reports
              clearly contradict what governors are saying, that it’s under
              control when it’s not.”

              Methane dissipates much more rapidly than carbon dioxide, but the
              gas is at least 86 times more potent during its first 20 years in
              the atmosphere. The EPA estimates that the oil and natural gas

              public safety—and it appeared to have the numbers to prove it. Its
              proposal said that Trump's rule would have a net economic benefit
              of up to $201 billion and would prevent nearly 12,700 deaths in

            <p>
              The Trump administration's final rule, which was released in March
              2020, does not entirely freeze the fuel economy and emissions
              standards. Instead, it requires automakers to increase fleet fuel
              economy by 1.5 percent annually—still a dramatic cut from the
              Obama standards, which would have been about 5 percent.
            </p>

            <p>
              The accompanying analysis was radically different as well. Rather
              than the massive benefit claimed in the draft, the final version
              <a

              that Trump's rollback could actually cost the economy as much as
              $22 billion, as compared to the Obama-era standards. Some critics
              find even this far less favorable conclusion dubious. In June, a
              coalition of advocacy groups petitioned the EPA to stay the final
              rule, writing that it is "premised on an analysis riddled with
              errors and inconsistencies."
            </p>

            <p>
              Dave Cooke, a senior vehicles analyst at the Union of Concerned
              Scientists, said some of the errors show evidence of the
              administration "putting its thumb on the scale towards a
              pre-ordained outcome." For instance, the petitioners claim that
              the new analysis added $27 billion in savings under the Trump rule
              by inflating the "cost of congestion"—an estimate of traffic's
              negative economic impact—under the Obama standards.

              The U.S. government has a calculation for the “social cost of
              carbon,” which measures the environmental, economic and public
              health damages associated with emitting carbon dioxide into the
              atmosphere. Federal agencies use this figure to evaluate the costs
              and benefits of new climate regulations. At the end of President
              Barack Obama’s tenure in office, that figure was $40 per metric
              ton (a number environmental groups

              rapid global warming.

              But shortly after taking office, President Donald Trump signed an

              by the Government Accountability Office determined that Trump’s
              calculations of the social cost of carbon are about seven times
              lower than previous federal estimates. And while Obama-era
              estimates placed future climate damages at $82 per ton of carbon
              by 2050, Trump’s calculation put it at just $11, the report found.
            </p>

            <p>
              The lower figure allows the administration to argue that the
              upfront costs of reining in greenhouse gas emissions outweigh any
              future benefit to property, agriculture, coastal ecosystems and
              human health. Trump's EPA has used the number to justify weakening
              environmental safeguards and to roll back Obama-era regulations
              that slashed carbon
              <a target="_blank" href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/pollution"
                >pollution</a
              >
              from power plants and new vehicles. For example, the EPA claims
              that rescinding the Clean Power Plan would save the U.S. $33
              billion in “avoided costs” by 2030, a calculation it came to by
              looking only at the domestic costs of carbon pollution and by
              downplaying the impact that emissions will have on future
              generations.

            <p>
              Meanwhile, the Trump administration has led a campaign to
              undermine the validity of climate modeling so it can ignore
              possible environmental threats when evaluating new infrastructure,
              such as pipelines, power plants, highways and airports. When more

              claimed the assessment was “based on the most extreme model

              Dramatically reducing immigration to the United States has been
              one of the Trump administration’s most cherished goals. In March
              2017, as the White House prepared to announce the maximum number
              of refugees the president would accept during the next year, he

              of persecution and conflict abroad.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Department of Health and Human Services produced a

                >55-page draft</a

              finances, as immigration hardliners contended, it found that
              refugees had contributed $63 billion more in government revenue
              than they had received in benefits between 2005 and 2014.
            </p>

            <p>
              That study never reached the White House. Instead, HHS handed in a
              three-page report that ignored refugees' fiscal contributions
              entirely. According to The New York Times, Stephen Miller,

                >ringleader</a
              >
              of the anti-immigration contingent, sought to keep the subject out
              of deliberations about the refugee cap. Miller

              told people at HHS: “The president believes refugees cost more,
              and the results of this study shouldn’t embarrass the president."
            </p>

            <p>
              In the end, the administration announced that it would admit a
              maximum of 45,000 refugees in the 2018 fiscal year—then a historic
              low. In 2021, the U.S. will accept no more than 15,000.

              Four days after President Donald Trump’s inauguration, the
              Department of Health and Human Services posted a draft revision of
              an annual survey it conducts to improve its services for disabled
              Americans. One month later, when the agency

              In 2016, after a protracted political fight, the Obama
              administration scored what looked like a win in its fight for
              equal pay for women and people of color: The Equal Employment
              Opportunity Commission finally got the go-ahead to start
              collecting pay data from large companies that was organized by
              gender, race and ethnicity.
            </p>

            <p>
              The EEOC is supposed to enforce federal antidiscrimination laws,
              and has long collected demographic data from companies that helps
              the agency detect discriminatory hiring patterns. Pay was a
              logical addition: A similar effort in the United Kingdom revealed
              significant differences in how much men and women earn in a
              surprising number of fields. Simply forcing companies to collect
              and report this kind of information might even push some to
              address disparities, experts reasoned.
            </p>

            <p>
              Alas, in the summer of 2017, the Trump administration nixed the
              whole thing. In a short memo, the Office of Management and Budget
              claimed with no evidence that collecting pay data would be too
              burdensome for companies and was of dubious utility. Ivanka Trump,
              a supposed proponent of equal pay, put out a statement supporting
              the move.
            </p>

            <p>
              In March 2019, a judge ruled that the administration had acted
              arbitrarily and that companies needed to turn over two years worth
              of pay data. Incredibly, most companies produced the numbers by
              the summer of 2020. And yet, the ruling doesn’t compel the EEOC to
              actually do anything with this trove of never-before-collected
              information.
            </p>

            <p>
              And so it hasn't. In what seems like an obvious stalling tactic,
              all the agency has done so far is announce that it will convene a
              panel of experts—merely to examine whether the data is of any use.
              Meanwhile, in the U.S., women on average continue to make 82
              percent of what men earn and Black women make only 62 percent.

              2015 recommended banning the pesticide due to its potential health
              risks. In September 2020, the agency released a new assessment of

              to address per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, the

              of a study into widespread PFAS contamination after a Trump aide
              warned it would be "potential public relations nightmare,"

              Since the early days of Trump’s administration, his Environmental
              Protection Agency has been on a mission to neuter Obama’s landmark
              air pollution restrictions. One tactic has proved especially
              consequential: changing the way that agencies evaluate the
              economics of environmental regulations. If, on paper, the cost of
              a regulation suddenly outweighs its benefits, the administration
              can argue that the rule is too expensive to keep.
            </p>

            <p>
              Changing these calculations is at the center of the EPA’s move to
              weaken a 2011 regulation curbing power plants’ mercury emissions,
              which can cause lasting brain damage in children and fetuses.
              After the rule was introduced, utility companies spent billions to
              meet the standards or switched to natural gas or renewable energy.
              Over the next six years, mercury emissions from power plants

                >fell by more than 80 percent</a
              >.
            </p>

            <p>
              But the rule had a vulnerability. To withstand legal challenges,
              Obama's EPA had to establish that its new emissions restrictions
              were "appropriate and necessary." Its most powerful arguments were
              about the huge public health gains: Curbing mercury pollution
              would slash other forms of power plant pollution as well,
              potentially preventing 130,000 asthma attacks, 4,500 heart
              attacks, and up to 11,000 premature deaths annually. The agency
              projected that the rule could save society up to $80 billion each
              year.
            </p>

            <p>
              To reach the opposite conclusion, Trump’s EPA simply decided to
              ignore almost all of the rule’s health benefits. EPA Administrator
              Andrew Wheeler argued that the agency should only measure the
              value of reducing mercury pollution, not any other indirect
              benefits that the rule would produce. After this mathematical
              sleight of hand, the rule was only projected to save $6 million
              annually—too little, the agency now said, to justify regulating
              mercury emissions. For now, the regulation remains intact, but the
              new assessment leaves it wide open to lawsuits from coal
              companies.

              indirect benefits of all pollution regulations under the Clean Air
              Act. “These economic cost-benefit analyses have been an important
              driver of Clean Air Act regulations for 40 years,” former EPA
              official Richard Morgenstern

              they are justified in writing weaker rules in the future.”

              a preliminary decision not to issue tougher standards governing

              by the fossil fuel industry. Wheeler insisted that he was simply
              following the science. In December 2019, a majority of the Clean
              Air Scientific Advisory Committee—a group of outside experts that
              advises the EPA—<a

                >draft report</a
              >
              that CASAC had reviewed to reach its recommendation, EPA
              scientists had advised tightening them, on the logic that
              long-term exposure to soot pollution was killing up to 52,100
              people in the U.S. annually. As Gretchen Goldman, a research
              director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, explained to The
              Washington Post, “It’s not surprising they would retain the
              standards, because they broke the process.”
            </p>

            <p>
              There are hundreds of advisory committees throughout the U.S.
              government, and they are part of a time-honored system that helps
              ensure that policy decisions are based on sound research.
              President Donald Trump’s administration has systematically
              sidelined, frozen and eliminated many of these committees.
            </p>

            <p>
              The attack was particularly fierce at the EPA. Trump's first
              administrator, Scott Pruitt, and his successor, Wheeler, have

                >openly questioned</a
              >
              whether air pollution causes serious health problems. For decades,
              CASAC had also convened panels of additional experts to help
              review the science on specific pollutants. Wheeler disbanded the
              panel that was assisting with the particulate matter standards.
              Six months later, CASAC
              <a

                >said</a
              >
              it lacked the expertise to carry out its review. But rather than
              reconvening the panel, Wheeler appointed a dozen new consultants.
              One of only two academic scientists on the committee pointed out
              that not a single expert in air pollution epidemiology was
              involved in the review. Inside Climate News
              <a

              that the recommendation to retain the soot standards partly rested
              on a widely criticized study based on unverified data.

              federal agencies to eliminate at least one-third of their
              committees and capped the total number across the government at
              350. So far, the EPA, the Department of Energy and the Department

              A look at two of the former CDC panels reveals the vital functions
              that advisory committees perform behind the scenes. For example:
              In recent years, evidence has mounted that glyphosate, an
              herbicide used in weed killers,
              <a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.usnews.com_news_national-2Dnews_articles_what-2Dto-2Dknow-2Dabout-2Dglyphosate-2Dthe-2Dpesticide-2Din-2Droundup-2Dweed-2Dkiller&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=sWW_bEwW_mLyN3Kx2v57Q8e-CRbmiT9yOhqES_g_wVY&amp;r=w1ge1X_kaitVYBWHNC9SUadHN2Z0SVlbSRK9nK3bd3U&amp;m=bKqYqkw7crMUzyT_hFNfVDntyM4yrV1uuIITNVkW0RU&amp;s=kKTBDJkwBAA6NO3wCsESpxXAmJDu4gklcWTUNp6kp5I&amp;e="
                >may cause cancer</a
              >. The CDC does not collect countrywide data on Americans'
              exposure to glyphosate, despite having a system—the National
              Biomonitoring Program—that does just that for more than 300 other
              dangerous chemicals. So a now-disbanded committee that advised
              both the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the
              CDC's National Center for Environmental Health was working to have
              glyphosate and other herbicides added to the list, according to
              former member Dr. Aaron Bernstein, a pediatrician and interim
              director of the Center for Climate, Health, and the Global
              Environment at Harvard University’s school of public health.
            </p>

            <p>
              The CDC also shut down its Advisory Committee to the Director,
              which consulted with agency leadership on big-picture strategy:
              Notably, it had advised CDC leaders during the Zika and Ebola
              outbreaks. “I'm looking at what's happening right now with
              COVID-19," said Dr. Lynn Goldman, a former committee member and
              dean of George Washington University's school of public health,
              "and I can't believe that the CDC director does not have a council
              of outside advisers that's able to serve as a sounding board for
              him.”

              In 1996, an enterprising tobacco industry lawyer named Chris
              Horner sent a memo to a client detailing a

                >plan</a
              >
              to stymie the Environmental Protection Agency’s crackdown on
              second-hand smoke. The idea was to “construct explicit procedural
              hurdles that the Agency must follow in issuing scientific
              reports”—in particular, requiring that agency data be transparent
              and independently reproducible. Sounds totally reasonable, right?
              In reality, it would disqualify a lot of peer-reviewed research.
              Steve Milloy, a lawyer with deep ties to tobacco and fossil fuel
              companies, became one of the biggest proponents of this war on
              so-called “secret science.”
            </p>

            <p>
              Fast forward more than two decades, and this industry playbook is
              set to become standard operating procedure at the EPA. In April
              2018, then-Administrator Scott Pruitt
              <a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pruitt-epa-transparency-rule-science_n_5adf44a8e4b07560f395fb16"
                >unveiled</a
              >
              a proposed “transparency” rule to limit the types of scientific
              studies that the agency can use to craft new policy. It allows the
              EPA to ignore studies that don’t make their raw data public,
              effectively giving more weight to industry-backed research.
            </p>

            <p>
              Most significantly, the latest version of the rule would
              disqualify public health studies that rely on keeping certain
              personal and medical information confidential. (This includes, for
              example,
              <a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/07042020/epa-secret-science-coronavirus-covid"
                >research on respiratory health</a
              >
              that could be key to combating COVID-19.) The goal, experts say,
              is to make it harder for the government to enact more stringent
              protections for our air, water and environment.
            </p>

            <p>
              Horner and Milloy, who served on Donald Trump’s EPA transition
              team, were both on hand for Pruitt’s announcement; Milloy has
              called it “one of my proudest achievements.” (The Interior
              Department later
              <a

              him on a similar initiative.) The agency intends to finalize the
              rule this year—and although it is all but certain to face legal
              challenges, it would likely take a future Democratic
              administration months, if not years, to undo.

              Every five years, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the
              Department of Health and Human Services ask a panel of experts to
              survey the most recent science and recommend what foods Americans
              should eat and drink to promote health and avoid chronic disease.

              The panel offers sober, scientific advice, but it can cause

            <p>
              For the latest round, the agencies dictated the topics the expert
              panel would address. The 80 questions the panel received omitted
              issues of red and processed meats, which mounting evidence links
              to diseases like colorectal cancer, and salt consumption, which
              studies show can affect cardiovascular health. They also excluded
              the effects of ultraprocessed foods, consumption of which is
              increasing.

              these issues “the most critical questions that need to be
              addressed in the guidelines"—and, coincidentally, said they
              “represent the issues that large food companies find most
              objectionable."

              The White House also limited the research that could be considered
              in studies the agency appointees had vetted, preventing the panel
              from weighing the full body of recent findings on health and food.
              During the last guidelines review in 2015, science from outside
              the agencies accounted for 50 percent of what the panel
              considered.
            </p>

            <p>
              The administration also stacked the panel with experts from
              industry groups like the National Potato Council, National
              Cattlemen's Beef Association and the American Beverage
              Association. Roughly half had ties to the International Life
              Sciences Institute, a notoriously bombastic industry group funded
              by agribusiness and pharmaceutical corporations.

              The result was a narrow set of recommendations, such as telling
              Americans to limit their added sugar intake to 6 percent of daily
              calories, down from 10 percent. Yet even that is drawing a
              backlash. In September, the conservative Heritage Foundation urged
              the Trump administration to “certainly not reduce the recommended
              limit,” because doing so would “defy logic.”

              When the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced in 2019 that it
              was relocating key research staff to Missouri, it may have seemed

              With a deregulatory agenda, the Trump administration has cut

              One of the most blatant examples of this is the administration’s

              to downplay the potential environmental impacts of future drilling
              in the refuge’s 1.56 million-acre coastal plain. Changes included
              modifying one biologist’s conclusions about the impact of seismic
              exploration surveys on polar bears, downgrading them from
              “uncertain or potentially harmful” to “less than significant,”

              ESA designations can have potentially far-reaching impacts. For
              example, conservationists have lobbied the government to protect
              the greater sage grouse, a ground-nesting bird imperiled by
              habitat loss, for years. Classification would restrict drilling
              and mining across millions of acres in the American West. Under
              President Barack Obama, the Interior Department reached a
              compromise with states and industry parties in 2015 that kept the
              bird off the federal endangered species list, which then-Interior
              Secretary Sally Jewell called a “milestone for conservation in
              America.” But in late 2019, the Trump administration reversed
              course,

              Bernhardt also played a key role in the administration’s radical
              overhaul of the ESA later that year, limiting regulators’ ability
              to account for the impacts of future climate change and allowing
              economic factors to be considered in whether to grant species
              protection—something the law previously prohibited.

              It sounds like the least partisan government activity imaginable:
              Every 10 years, the Census Bureau fans out across the country to
              count the people who inhabit it. And yet the 2020 census has
              become the target of a relentless sabotage campaign.
            </p>

            <p>
              First, congressional Republicans limited the agency to the $12.3
              billion it spent in 2010, even though a growing population means
              each census is more complicated than the last. This forced the
              bureau to scale back its ambitions and roll out new counting
              methods without adequate testing.
            </p>

            <p>
              Then, in March, the bureau had to suspend field operations due to
              the coronavirus pandemic. The following month, the Trump
              administration asked Congress to extend the deadlines for data
              collection and processing, but ended up reversing its decision in
              July, sending agency staff scrambling. A California court
              <a

              in September that data collection could continue through the end
              of October, but on October 13, the Supreme Court granted the Trump
              administration’s request to halt the census pending further
              litigation, effectively ending the count.

              have all sounded alarms that this truncated timeline will result
              in significant gaps in population statistics. As of October 13,
              the bureau
              <a

                href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020/2020-census-count-99point9-percent-complete.html"
                >claimed to have counted 99.9 percent</a

              of U.S. households. The American Statistical Association, however,
              <a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/POL-2020CensusQualityIndicators.pdf"
                >noted</a
              >
              that this figure only takes into account the quantity of data, not
              the quality. Many Americans have been counted “by proxy,” meaning
              their information was collected from their neighbors rather than
              directly—to pick just one of the corners field workers had to cut
              to finish on time.
            </p>

            <p>
              The chaos of the 2020 count is unprecedented, said Bruce Spencer,
              a statistician at Northwestern University.
            </p>

            <p>
              “This is the first time I’ve seen the government try to damage the
              counting process,” he said. In previous years, Spencer said,
              Democrats and Republicans squabbled over statistical analysis
              after the count was finished, but political actors have never
              interfered in the basic data-gathering.
            </p>

            <p>
              The errors in the 2020 census will not be evenly distributed. The
              population count nearly always overrepresents white Americans
              while systematically overlooking minorities. The 2010 census
              overcounted whites by 0.8 percent and undercounted Blacks by 2.1
              percent. Native Americans on reservations were undercounted by
              10.6 percent in 1990, overcounted by 0.5 percent in 2000 and
              undercounted by 4.9 percent in 2010.
            </p>

            <p>
              And the errors get worse with more specific subgroups. The 2010
              census
              <a

                href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-8990-5_4"
                >undercounted children</a
              >
              by roughly 1.7 percent, but Black and Hispanic children were
              undercounted by 4.6 percent and 7.5 percent, respectively. And
              while Hispanics were undercounted by 1.5 percent overall,
              undocumented immigrants
              <a

                >were undercounted</a
              >
              by up to 14 percent.
            </p>

            <p>
              These gaps have far-reaching consequences. Companies use
              population figures to
              <a
                target="_blank"

                >determine</a
              >
              where they should locate stores and open factories. Public polling
              firms use census data to adjust their results. Undercounting
              hard-to-reach populations creates a fiction of a whiter, richer,
              more educated America that will echo through the country’s basic
              statistics for the next decade.
            </p>

            <p>
              “This is the invisible data infrastructure of the country,” said
              Jonathan Auerbach, a statistician at the American Statistical
              Association. “It’s the basis of an entire ecosystem of data
              products that informs millions of government decisions.”
            </p>

            <p>
              What matters most, Auerbach said, isn’t the raw error rate
              throughout the country, but the difference in error rates between
              states. More than $675 billion in federal funding is tied to
              census allocations, from the

            </p>

            <p>
              Census errors could even affect public health. Medicaid spending
              is

                >allocated</a
              >
              according to states’ income data—missing low-income voters will
              make states look richer than they are, resulting in less federal
              funding. If the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention manages
              to produce a COVID-19 vaccine, census counts will likely affect
              the number of doses
              <a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/08/2020-census-count-incomplete-congress-immigrants.html"
                >allocated</a
              >
              to each state.
            </p>

            <p>
              And then there are the political consequences. A census error rate
              of just 4 percent could shift as many as 12 House seats from one
              state to another, according to a
              <a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/documents/working-papers/2018/wp-18-10.pdf"
                >2018 analysis</a

              before drawing new district boundaries, they will end up diluting
              the votes of their poor and minority populations.
            </p>

            <p>“It’s taking gerrymandering one step further,” Spencer said.</p>

            <p>Which is, of course, the whole point.</p>

            <p>
              “I see no scientific value to speeding up the census—only

                Imagery in this article has been manipulated using degradative
                rendering techniques causing loss of data. Background
                transitions are also created through the removal and replacement
                of data. This is fun for design. It’s unacceptable when the data
                concerned is the paper trail of your country’s governance.
